**Analysis of Aviation Accidents from 1919 to 2023**

The newly established IASS (International Alliance for Safe Skies) has tasked you with conducting a thorough analysis of all aviation accidents that occurred between 1919 and 2023.

To this end, you are provided with a dataset containing nearly 25,000 recorded incidents with the following information:

date: the date of the accident

type: aircraft type

registration: aircraft registration code

operator: aircraft operator

fatalities: number of deaths

location: accident location

country: country where the accident occurred

cat: accident category as classified by ASN

Use the data to uncover valuable insights, including through charts and visualizations.

Examples of Insights
These are examples of questions you can answer using the data, but don't limit yourself to themâ€”conduct an in-depth analysis by asking additional questions you believe could lead to meaningful insights:

In which country have the most accidents occurred?

Do accidents happen more frequently on specific days of the week?

Who are the safest operators?

What type of aircraft has caused the highest number of fatalities?

How have accidents evolved after September 11th?
